# Release Notes

## Unreleased

### Highlights

#### Training performance

Most of the loss and backward path was rewritten over the cycle. SSIM moved to a dedicated fused kernel and was then folded together with L1 into a single forward pass ([#394](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/394), [#401](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/401)). SSIM's saved-for-backward tensors are now recomputed on the fly ([#409](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/409)). The per-splat backward early-outs for splats that don't actually contribute to any pixel ([#394](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/394)). Internal gradients and buffers are sparse where they used to be dense ([#378](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/378)). Ground-truth images are packed to u32 RGBA on the GPU with background compositing and masking folded into the loss kernel, roughly 4x less pixel-side memory plus a chain of mixed-dtype Burn ops gone ([#410](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/410)). The radix sort was rewritten to be ~50% faster, which also lifted rendering ~10-15% ([#386](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/386)). Loading throughput and peak memory both improved meaningfully ([#280](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/280), [#325](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/325)).

#### Reconstruction quality & densification

The growth path got a real overhaul: longer-edge split, "uni" noise, and a fix for far-away splats being deleted too early ([#265](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/265)). Force-split kicks in for splats that grow too big, then later gated by `growth_stop_iter` to avoid pathological end-of-training behaviour ([#390](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/390), [#398](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/398)). Random frustum init helps when there are no good initial points ([#372](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/372)). NaN handling was tightened up with a new fuzz suite ([#389](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/389)).

#### Appearance compensation (hybrid PPISP grid, bilateral grid, and PPISP)

Training can now learn per-view photometric corrections so exposure, white-balance, and vignetting variation between input images is not baked into the splats. `--ppisp-grid` enables the Spirulae-style hybrid of per-camera vignetting and per-view spatial PPISP payloads, `--bilateral-grid` enables per-view affine grids, and `--ppisp` enables NVIDIA's full per-frame/per-camera PPISP model. The mutually exclusive modes use CubeCL kernels with custom autodiff; corrections apply to the rendered image before the loss and remain training-only, so exported splats keep canonical colors. Grid modes use sparse per-view optimizer state with bounded allocation, and `--train-on-eval` lets evaluation apply learned corrections for evaluation views retained in training.

#### Mip-Splatting

The 2D mip filter from Mip-Splatting is now implemented, with a `render_mode` flag and a UI toggle. Contributed by @fhahlbohm ([#337](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/337)).

#### LOD baking

After training, Brush can optionally generate N lower-detail levels by iteratively decimating splats and refining against downscaled images. Each level exports as its own `.ply` with a `_lodN` suffix. CLI/GUI knobs: `lod_levels`, `lod_refine_steps`, `lod_decimation_keep`, `lod_image_scale`. Contributed by @mvaligursky ([#365](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/365)).

#### Embedding & web demos

Two new front doors for using Brush as a library: a C FFI (`brush-c`) for native embedding ([#308](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/308)), and `brush-js`, a thin `wasm-bindgen` wrapper that lets any JS page drive Brush directly ([#402](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/402)). Hosts get zero-copy access to the WebGPU buffers backing the transforms / SH coefficients / opacities, so they can bind them straight into their own render pipelines without ever round-tripping splat data through CPU. The web demos moved from Next.js to Vite + React in the process. The web viewer can also accept initial camera position and rotation via URL parameters ([#309](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/309)).

#### UI overhaul

Several rounds of cleanup: tabbed sidebar, persistent layout, a status bar that hosts export / live-view / play-pause, notches in the progress bar marking export points, a settings window editable while training, full save/load of training configs, framing bars for reference poses, more background controls including random noise, and DPI-aware splat rendering. ([#299](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/299), [#329](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/329), [#330](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/330), [#334](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/334), [#335](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/335), [#338](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/338), [#346](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/346), [#347](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/347), [#362](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/362), [#377](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/377), [#399](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/399)).

#### Masking & alpha

More mask folder layouts accepted (COLMAP's `masks/img.jpeg.png`, `img.mask.*`, masks at arbitrary folder depths), mask resizing, and a configurable `--alpha_mode` exposed in CLI and UI ([#298](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/298), [#300](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/300), [#301](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/301)).

#### Web compatibility & robustness

WebGPU's workgroup dispatch limit is handled correctly, so resolutions above 2048 work ([#363](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/363), from @promontis). A long-standing intersection-buffer corruption is fixed ([#373](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/373)), as is a separate sort corruption past ~78M keys ([#385](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/385)). Intersection and splat limits were raised so larger and higher-resolution scenes work ([#340](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/340)).

#### Under the hood

All WGSL kernels have been ported to CubeCL `#[cube]` kernels, with shared math types (`Vec3A`, `Quat`, `Mat3`, `Sym2`) in a new `brush-cube` crate. The port surfaced and fixed a long-standing fuzz failure where FP drift between `project_forward` and `map_gaussians_to_intersect` left uninitialised slots in the intersection list ([#411](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/411)).

## 0.3

Brush 0.3

Brush 0.3 is a massive update to bring high quality splats to all platforms, while training faster, and bringing a ton of new features!

Brush now trains using the "MCMC" splatting technique, but, with its own variation that still grows splats automatically. This keeps the best of both worlds: splats grow first where they are needed, yet explore the scene like in MCMC, to improve quality. This [table](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/121) has some preliminary results. You can set a limit of the maximum number of splats like in the original MCMC. Training works especially better on large scenes where not all views are visible from all angles. Training now also supports massive datasets bigger than RAM and starts instantly.

The web version also gains a lot of new features, with fullscreen modes, efficient file loading, directory loading, bundler integration, NPM compatibility, and faster training. Training on the web is not nearly at feature parity with the desktop version.

### Highlights:

**Training**

- "MCMC like" training. Higher quality and more robust. Still grows splats automatically like previous methods, while also allowing a maximum nr. of splats cap. For a more detailed write up, see [this PR](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/121)

- Train on datasets bigger than RAM. Only up to some amount of gigs are cached, other files are loaded by the dataloader while training. [[1]](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/commit/8f1a09d2e8a1aef8a2fd0fc78e11e05dee234645)

## 0.2

Brush 0.2 goes from a proof of concept to a tool ready for real world data! It still only implements the “basics” of Gaussian Splatting, but trains as fast as gsplat to a (slightly) higher quality than gsplat. It also comes with nicer workflows, a CLI, dynamic gaussian rendering, and lots of other new features.

The next release will focus on going beyond the basics of Gaussian Splatting, and implementing extensions that help to make Brush more robust, faster, and higher quality than other splatting alternatives. This might mean that the outputs are no longer 100% compatible with other splat viewers, so more work will also be done to make the Brush web viewer a great experience.

### Features

- Brush now measures higher PSNR/SSIM than gsplat on the mipnerf360 scenes. Of course, gsplat with some more tuned settings might reach these numbers as well, but this shows Brush is grown up now!
  - See the [results table](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush?tab=readme-ov-file#results)

- Faster training overall by optimizing the kernels, fixing various slowdowns, and reducing memory use.

- Brush now has a CLI!
  - Simply run brush –help to get an overview. The basic usage is brush PATH –args.
  - Any command works with `--with-viewer` which opens the UI for easy debugging.

- Add flythrough controls supporting both orbiting, FPS controls, flythrough controls, and panning.
  - See the ‘controls’ popout in the scene view for a full overview.

- Load data from a URL. If possible the data will be streamed in, and the splat will update in real-time.
  -For a web version, just pass in ?url=

- On the web, pass in ?zen=true to enable ‘zen’ mode which makes the viewer fullscreen.

- Add support for viewing dynamic splats
  - Either loaded as a sequence of PLY files (in a folder or zip)
  - Or as a custom data format “ply with delta frames”
  - This was used for [Cat4D](https://cat-4d.github.io/) and for [Cap4D](https://felixtaubner.github.io/cap4d/)
  - Felix kindly shared [their script](https://github.com/felixtaubner/brush_avatar/) to export this data for reference.

- Open directories directly, instead of only zip files.
  - ZIP files are still supported for all operations - as this is important for the web version.

- Support transparent images.
  - Images with alpha channels will force the output splat to _match_ this transparency.
  - Alternatively, you can include a folder of ‘masks’. This will _ignore_ those parts of the image while training.

- More flexible COLMAP & nerfstudio dataset format
  - Support more of the various options, and differing file structures.
  - If your dataset has a single ply file, it will be used for the initial point cloud.

  - While training, the up-axis is rotated such that the ground is flat (thanks to @fhahlbohm)
    - Note: The exported ply will however still match your input data. I’m investigating how to best handle this in the future - either as an option to rotate the splat, or by writing metadata into the exported splat.

### Enhancements

- Add alpha_loss_weight arg to control how heavy to weigh the alpha loss
  - Nb: not applicable to masks mode
- Log memory usage to rerun while training
- Fix SH clamping values to 0 ([#76](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/76) thanks to @fhahlbohm)
- Better logic to pick ‘nearest’ dataset view
- Better splat pruning logic
- Remove ESC to close
- The web version has SSIM enabled again
- Display more detailed error traces in the UI and CLI when something goes wrong
- Different method of emitting tile intersections ([#63](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/pull/63) for details)
  - Fixes some potential corruptions depending on your driver/shader compiler.
- Read up-axis from PLY file if it’s included
- Eval PSNR/SSIM now simulate a 8 bit roundtrip for fair comparison
- Add an option `--export-every` to export a ply file every so many steps
  - See `--export-path` and `--export-name` for the location of the ply
- Add an option `--eval-save-to-disk` to save eval images to disk
  - See `–export-path` for
- Add notes in CLI & UI about running in debug mode (advising to compile with `--release`).
- Relax camera constraints, allow further zoom in/out
- Relax constraints on fields in the UI - now can enter values outside of slider range.
- Improvements to the UI, less unnecessary padding.

### Highlighted Fixes

- Dataset and scene view now match exactly 1:1
- Fix UI sometimes not updating when starting a new training run.
- Sort eval images to be consistent with the MipNeRF eval images
- Fix a crash from the KNN initialization
